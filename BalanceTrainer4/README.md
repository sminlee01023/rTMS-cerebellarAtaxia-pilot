For this project, balance data were collected from patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) using the Balance Trainer 4 (HUR, Finland).  <br />
Each participant was asked to maintain a standing position for 30 seconds under two conditions: with eyes closed and with eyes open.  <br />
These measurements provide quantitative assessment of postural stability in CA patients.
